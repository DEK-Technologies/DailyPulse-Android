    <p><b>How this was developed:</b> At DEK Technologies we use a hardware voting panel named
    DailyPulse for having employees vote for how they feel on a certain day.
    DailyPulse is made by Celpax company reachable at <a href="http://www.celpax.com/">
    http://www.celpax.com/</a><br/></p>

    <p><b>User Guide</b><br/>
    You are meant to vote only once during a given day. In case you vote more than once, the app
    would only know that this is not your first time voting.<br/>
    If not successful - In case the vote you submit via this mobile application fails to be sent,
    for example in case you are disconnected from Internet, your vote will be stored to be sent
    with the next vote that you will submit. Once your vote is submitted successfully, the app
    would not store the user\'s vote on the mobile, and will erase the records.</p>


    <p><b>Privacy</b><br/>

    This app does not aim to disclose your identity. As our users\' privacy is of utmost
    non-negotiable nature to us.<br/>We at DEK Technologies AB Sweden have queried Celpax if
    they can link users\' votes with their identity later to track who has voted, who has voted
    happy or sad. Celpax directed us to their privacy policy on their website and stated that they
    do not store in any manner any information that can later on be used to link users\' identity
    with your activities and votes.<br/>
